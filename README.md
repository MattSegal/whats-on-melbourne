### User Stories

As a user...

I want to know...

* where gigs are on tonight in Melbourne
* what time the gig is on
* what other gigs are on at that venue
* how much the tickets cost

I want to be able to...

* filter by genre
* filter by time
* browse to the band's website / facebook
* browse to the venue website

so that I can figure out where to go out tonight



As a website owner..

I want to attribute my sources
so that I drive some traffic their way.
